How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?


User needs are interpreted into User Stories, which in turn generate definitions of done and minimum viability standards of a finished product. These are in turn ingested into a product backlog. User stories assist the SDLC by cataloguing the program functionality from the enduser perspective, which is the ultimate reason for engineering the software in the first place.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?


I approach developing programs as a part of a coordinated larger whole. My effort is to synchronize with the efforts of my team towards a productive sprint. I hope to incorporate the agile processes of transparency, teamwork and quality being built into the development process into every aspect of my future development work. This course has opened my eyes to how larger teams coordinate and build complex software. I greatly appreciate how Scrum Agile practices break what is a mammoth task into bite-sized pieces that everyone has some accountability towards.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?


A good team member is transparent, open and collaborative. A team member at any point can be a teacher, coach, subject matter expert, student, and learner over the course of a project. It's OKAY not to know everything and asking questions is ENCOURAGED and NECESSARY to be successful. Failing Early and Failing Often is critical, and the sooner any team adopts the humility to productively fail the better off that team is.
